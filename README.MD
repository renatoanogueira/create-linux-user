This is a script used to create users in linux. I was looking this solution to simplify how to create users with SFTP access only. Of course I could to pass the parameters through bash, but just call the script and insert user and password looks better.

The script was copied from this link: https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-write-shell-script-to-add-user.html
and some paramaters was changed do fullfill my needs.
